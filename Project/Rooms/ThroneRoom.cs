//     //Description:
//     //"As you unlock the door and swing it wide you see an enormous hall stretching out before you. 
//     //At the opposite end of the hall sitting on his throne you see the dark lord. The Dark Lord shouts at you 
//     //demanding why you dared to interrupt him during his Ritual of Evil Summoning... Dumbfounded you mutter an 
//     //incoherent response. Becoming more enraged the Dark Lord complains that you just ruined his concentration 
//     //and he will now have to start the ritual over... Quickly striding towards you he smirks at least I know have 
//     //a sacrificial volunteer. Plunging his jewel encrusted dagger into your heart your world slowly fades away.
